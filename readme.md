# Taxi
A (small) game framework inspired by [Blah](https://github.com/NoelFB/blah/), [Halley](https://github.com/amzeratul/halley/), [Processing](https://github.com/processing/), and XNA/FNA/Monogame.

The goal of this project is to just have something to play around with. I'm not sure if this will ever be finished or if I'll ever make a game with it.

It's probably also worth mentioning, I am horrable at c++. So please, don't expect really good code.

At the moment, the renderer is just going to be an SDL Renderer. Later on I might add something like OpenGL or DirectX. However even then I'll still use SDL for windowing and input.

> Note: This project is nowhere near finished. At the moment you can only make a window.
